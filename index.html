        <p>I am a Software Engineering student studing at Brigham Young Univiersity - Idaho. I will graduate in July
            2021. I have a passion for creating new things with the code that I write. Being able to develop something
            that didn't exsist before that is something that I find amazing. I love being able to create applications
            that can help others. I enjoy finding others who have ideas about what they want and find ways to help bring
            their ideas to reality. Working with others to make something that they couldn't make by themself is
            amazing.</p>
