        <p>I am a Software Engineering student studing at Brigham Young Univiersity - Idaho. I will graduate in July
            2021. I have a passion for creating new things with the code that I write. Being able to develop something
            that didn't exsist before I made it, changes the way that I look at the world. I am able to reate new tools
            to help people by making my ideas become a reality. I love being able to create applications
            that can help others. I enjoy finding others who have ideas who need help. Taking what they want and finding
            ways to help bring their ideas to reality is something that I enjoy. Working with others to make something
            that they couldn't make by themself is amazing.</p>
