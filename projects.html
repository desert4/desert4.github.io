                        <p>Hope for Healing Foundation is a non-profit group based out of Salt Lake City, Utah. I am
                            currently working on development. This prject started out as a group of three students but
                            is now a project that I am working on by my self. This app allows the user to view different
                            aspects of their life and find tasks that they can do to help them fight their depression.
                            Below are pictures that represent the app. Featured are the home screen, tasks sceen, and
                            phases screen. The home sceen acts as a navigation to all of the other screens. The tasks
                            screen shows different things that they can do to help them in that area. The phases screen
                            shows the what things they should be doing in the morning, afternoon, and evening.

                        <p>I helped to develop a website for the Idaho Injury Law Group. I created a members area only
                            accessable to those with a account for the company. In addition to this it allowed for
                            contact information to be collected and submitted to the company. <br><b>Note:</b> Becuase
                            this

                        <p>I developed a skiing help website. In this website I implemented a database that holds
                            various different resorts. It allows a visitor to view the different resorts in the
                            database. Someone can create an account and leave a review if they want. It takes these
                            various reviews and shows them below each resort.<br> Click here to go to the website: <a href="https://rocky-reef-99024.herokuapp.com/project1/ski.php">Skiing Website</a></p>
